This is a simple .exe to run to convert audio files for my summer car. Download the ZIP in the releases area, extract it in your MSC directory, put mp3's in your CD/radio files, and run it.


Note:

- When using, you must put the mp3s in the file you want them converted in: CD1, CD2, CD3, and Radio.

- This can only convert mp3's.

- You must have ffmpeg.exe, & ffprobe.exe in the same extension, I am not the creator of ffmpeg or ffprobe, however I am uploading the correct file for ease of use.

- Both ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe, and this script, must be in the same directory, which is the main directory of MSC.
